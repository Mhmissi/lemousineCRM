  driverName: string,      // Driver's display name
  client: string,          // Client name
  pickup: string,          // Pickup address
  destination: string,     // Destination address
  date: string,            // Trip date (YYYY-MM-DD)
  time: string,            // Full time range (HH:MM - HH:MM)
  startTime: string,       // Start time (HH:MM)
  endTime: string,         // End time (HH:MM)
  vehicle: string,         // Vehicle name
  passengers: number,      // Passenger count
