# Testing Driver Notification Flow

## Overview
This document outlines how to test the new driver notification system when trips are assigned.

## Test Steps

### 1. Setup Test Data
- Ensure you have at least one driver with a Firebase Auth account
- Ensure you have at least one vehicle in the system
- Make sure you're logged in as an owner/admin

### 2. Create a New Trip
1. Navigate to the Trips section in the owner dashboard
2. Click "Add Trip" button
3. Fill in the trip form:
   - Select a driver (must have Firebase Auth ID)
   - Select a vehicle
   - Enter pickup location
   - Enter destination
   - Set date and time
   - Enter client name
   - Set passenger count and revenue
4. Click "Create Trip"

### 3. Verify Owner Notification
- Check that the owner receives a local notification about trip creation
- Verify the notification appears in the notification bell

### 4. Test Driver Notification
1. Log out as owner
2. Log in as the assigned driver
3. Navigate to the driver dashboard
4. Check the "My Trips" tab

### Expected Results

#### Driver Dashboard Should Show:
1. **New Trip Notifications Section**: A blue highlighted section at the top showing new trip assignments
2. **Notification Details**: Each notification should display:
   - Title: "New Trip Assigned"
   - Message with client, pickup, destination, and date
   - Additional details: client name, date, time range
   - Unread indicator (blue dot)

#### Notification Center Should Show:
1. **Trip Notifications**: Filter by "Trip Notifications" to see all trip-related notifications
2. **Proper Formatting**: Notifications should be properly formatted with icons and priority colors
3. **Mark as Read**: Clicking notifications should mark them as read

#### Trip Table Should Show:
1. **New Trip**: The newly created trip should appear in the driver's trip list
2. **Correct Status**: Trip should show as "assigned" status
3. **All Details**: All trip details should be visible and correct

### 5. Test Notification Persistence
1. Refresh the driver dashboard page
2. Verify notifications persist and are loaded from Firestore
3. Check that unread count is maintained

### 6. Test Multiple Notifications
1. Create multiple trips for the same driver
2. Verify all notifications appear
3. Test the "View all X notifications" functionality

## Troubleshooting

### If Notifications Don't Appear:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify driver has Firebase Auth ID
3. Check Firestore rules allow notification creation
4. Verify notification service is working

### If Driver Dashboard Doesn't Show Notifications:
1. Check if NotificationCenter component is imported
2. Verify notification context is properly connected
3. Check if notifications are being filtered correctly

### If Trip Doesn't Appear in Driver List:
1. Verify driverFirebaseAuthId matches driver's Firebase Auth UID
2. Check trip filtering logic in loadDriverTrips function
3. Verify trip data structure matches expected format
